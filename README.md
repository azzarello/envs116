# Welcome Alec

## Pre-reqs
Because of the massive file sizes, I needed to use `git lfs` to commit all my files up to github, so you may need to install it if you don't have it already. I believe you can directly download a zip archive from the GH web interface, but if you still have issues, I can zip it and email.

## File Structure
This is a repo for all my coursework in this class, that I have caught up on, but you the issue we discussed today is in the `FinalProject` directory. In the weirdly nested `ProjectFiles` directory (don't ask me, ask ESRI), I have the Sammamish parking lots in the `Default.gdb`, the block groups from the census are pre-converted to `NAD 1984 ...` in the `AnalysisOutput.gdb`. This should be all you need to recreate the hurdle I couldn't clear earlier. I am essentially trying to determine the _parking density_ on a census block level to better make fair comparisons to Seattle proper. I could very easily just attempt the same thing on an entire city level, but the aesthetic benefit of that granularity and the insight I hope to mine from it makes me a bit stubborn to completely abandon that approach.

There is other data in the `SourceData` folder if you feel so inclined to find a good middle ground that is successful, but mostly just throwing that fact out there just in case. 

Very much appreciated sir.
